This project was undertaken during my final semester of the Data Science course. Throughout the duration of the class, I gained insights into various data terminologies, such as "Items" and "Attributes," which are essential components when dealing with data. For instance, datasets exhibit distinct features and variables. Additionally, the course covered topics such as handling missing data, exploring concepts like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), model complexity, cross-validation, linear regression, preprocessing, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees.
